1. Go through vim tutorials by making all the experiments/examples.

  Done.

2. Replace all occurrences of 'abc' with 'xyz_N' where N is an ascending number.

  :let @n=1 | %s/abc/\='xyz_'.(@n+setreg('n', @n+1))/g

3. Add line number before line.

  :%s/^/\=line('.').'.'

4. Change the data to make a dictionary for a Python program(use record mode):
Input:
    one    first example
    two    second example
    three    third example
    four    fourth example
Output:
    data = {
        'one': 'first example',
        'two': 'second example',
        'three': 'third example',
        'four': 'fourth example',
}

5. Edit file to delete duplicate rows.
Input:

6. Prepare 10 powerful examples of vim usage (at least 2 of them should be from record mode usage). Please be sure not to duplicate the examples.
7. Go through the following link http://vimgenius.com/ and share the results :))) (the screen shot of 7-th level).
