1. Go through vim tutorials by making all the experiments/examples.

  Done.

2. Replace all occurrences of 'abc' with 'xyz_N' where N is an ascending number.

  :let @n=1 | %s/abc/\='xyz_'.(@n+setreg('n', @n+1))/g

3. Add line number before line.

  :%s/^/\=line('.').'.'

4. Change the data to make a dictionary for a Python program(use record mode):
Input:
    one first example
    two second example
    three third example
    four fourth example
Output:
    data = {
        'one': 'first example',
        'two': 'second example',
        'three': 'third example',
        'four': 'fourth example',
}

  1)Type:     
        one first example
        two second example
        three third example
        four fourth example
  2)Put the cursor on the first 'o'
    Type qni->'->Esc->ea->':->Esc->wi->'->Esc->2ea->',->Esc->q->j0w->@n->j0w->@n...
  3)Add data = {} 

5. Edit file to delete duplicate rows.
Input:
    1
    1
    1
    2
    2
    3
Output:
    1
    2
    3

  :g/^\(.*\)\n\1/d

6. Prepare 10 powerful examples of vim usage (at least 2 of them should be from record mode usage). Please be sure not to duplicate the examples.

  1):%s/^\(.*\)\n\1$/\1/        #Delete lines which appears twice
  2):v/string/d                 #Delete all lines containing which didnâ€™t contain string
  3)ggguG                       #Set all text to lowercase
  4)vE~                         #Modify word case
  5):set shiftwidth=4           #Defines 4 spaces as indent size
  6):call setreg('x', '')       #Delete a recording
  7):let @b=@a                  #Copy the macro from register a to register b
  8):set wrap                   #Wrap the lines
  9):global/^/m 0               #Move all the lines before the first line
  10):map \p i(<Esc>ea)<Esc>    #Add parentheses around a word with "\p"

7. Go through the following link http://vimgenius.com/ and share the results :))) (the screen shot of 7-th level).

  Done.
