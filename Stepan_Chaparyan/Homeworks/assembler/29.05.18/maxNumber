Homework:

Need to find maxNumber:

We have assembler commands add and mv:
We have four registers R1, R2, R3, R4:

Need to find maxNumber from 6 elements:

move 1st element to R1
move 2nd element to R2
move 3th element to R3
Array[R1, R2, R3]

for i in Array
  if Array[i] > maxNumber
     maxNumber = numberArray[i]	
R4 = maxNumber


move 4th element to R1
move 5nd element to R2
move 6th element to R3

for i in Array
  if Array[i] > maxNumber
     maxNumber = numberArray[i]	
R4 = maxNumber
