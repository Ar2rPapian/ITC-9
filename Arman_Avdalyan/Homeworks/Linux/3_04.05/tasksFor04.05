Hello,

Answers to the questions:

    1. We can do that with [$ls > filePath] command.
    2. We can do that as above but we must be su to have permission.
            1.$sudo su.
            2.$ls > /home.
    3. [$uname -a > filePath] adding Linux info to file.
    4. We can add path to PATH variable so [PATH=$PATH:/home/arman/].
    5. PS1="\e[0;32m\d \t \e[m".
            \e[ start color scheme.
            0;32 is the color.
            <d> is date and <t> is time.
            \e[m : Stop color scheme.
       Run [$export PS1] to add variable to list.
    6. 1. We can set number to the lines with [:set number] command in vim(normal mod). 
          Or we can see numbered content, without changing the file so [$cat -n /var/log/syslog]
       
       2. To see file content we can type [$cat filePath] command.

       3. To sort file we can use [$sort filePath -o filePath]. 
            -o --> write output to the second file(we can save the output in the same file).
       
       4. See the first / last n(5) lines from file [$head -n filePath] / [$tail -n filePath].

       5. Show folder content which isn't starting with D letter -> [$ls [^D]*] or [$ls -I D*].

    7. 1. To find files greater 200mb [$sudo find -size +200M].
       2. Copy all folders and files starting with P an M -> [$cp -r ~/P* ~/M* path].
       3. Copy sda1 to the <path> [$sudo dd if=/dev/sda1 of=path].
       4. We can cut file into 3 parts so [$split -3 filePath]. It will create 3 different folders and put there datas from file.
       5. Zip directory with tar -> [$tar czf name.tar.gz folderPath].
          With gzip we can't compress directory, we just can compress the whole files into that [$gzip -r folderPath].

Thanks.
