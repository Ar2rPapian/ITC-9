Hello,

Answers to the questions:

    1. What initialization style does my computer use(systemd, sysv, upstart)?
        Answer: That styles are the first processes in Linux system, so we can run [pstree] command and see the first process or run [ps -p 1] to see the first process at once.

    2. How to check which boot loader installed in computer?
        Answer 1: To check loader we can install this script [sudo apt install boot-info-script] and run this command sudo bootinfoscript. 
                It will create RESULT.txt file. In that file we can find a lot of information about bootloader, partitions, file systems, etc.                 At the start, below this line [Boot Info Summary:] we can find information about bootloader:
        Answer 2: The bootloaders are located in /boot folder. If we open that file we can see grub or lilo folder.

    3. a. Where is located grub config file?
        Answer: It is located in /etc/default/grub.

       b. How to set grub screen show time 10 second?
        Answer: We need to open /etc/default/grub file (as su to rewrite file) and change GRUB_DEFAULT=0 to GRUB_DEFAULT=10.

       c. How to disable grub boot splash screen?
        Answer: We need to open config file and delete "quiet splash" from this line -> GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash".
                    It will be look like this GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="".

       d. How to change grub pressing time(20 seconds)?
        Answer: In the same file we need to change GRUB_TIMEOUT=10 to GRUB_TIMEOUT=20.

    4. In which file we can change names from grub list?
        Answer: We can change the names in /boot/grub/grub.cfg file.
            Example(in case Ubuntu): We need to find Ubuntu menuentry line and change the name.
                    By default it look like this [menuentry 'Ubuntu' --class ubuntu ...etc]. We need to change the name from quotesâ€¤

    Note: After every change in grub config we need to update grub.

Thanks.
