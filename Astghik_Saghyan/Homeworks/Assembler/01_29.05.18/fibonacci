I use the following commands:

mov
add 
jump
jz
ceq

I have the following registers:

R0 n
R1 first

The number n is writen in 0x0 address of Memory
I need to find the nth number of Fibonacci series

The program is:

move R1, 0
move R2, 1
	lable1:
ceq R0, 1
jz lable2
add R0, -1
move R3, R1
move R1, R2 
add R2, R3
jump lable1
	lable2:
