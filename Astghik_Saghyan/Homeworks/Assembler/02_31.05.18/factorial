I use the following commands:

mov
jump
jnz
ceq
mult

I have the following registers:

R0 factorial
R1 n-1
R2 
R3 

The number n is writen in 0x0 address of Memory
I need to find factorial of n.

The program is:

move R0, *0x0
move R1, R0
loop:
	ceq R1, 1
	jnz print	
	add R1, -1
	mult R0, R1
	jump loop
print:
	print R0
