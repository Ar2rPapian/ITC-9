Please, run the program using Python 3 or high
1.I split my string by "," 
then I check if the key has quotes.
My key should be like "mykey".
If it is like "my,kay",
then program will split it like "my and kay",
and when it will check the quotes, the program will return false

2.After spliting by ","
	I split by ":",
	then I check the the length of geted list.
	If it is greater then 2, the program returns false.
	So if I have something like "kay":"val:ue"
	the program will return false.
