I have the following commands:

input
output
mv
get
add 
sub
if loop
jump

I have the following registers:

R1
R2
R3
R4

The program is:

input nth (receiving the n-th number)
mv nth R1 (write nth in register 1)
first = 0 
mv first R2
second = 1
mv second R3
count = 0
mv count R4
linex:   get nth R1 (read from register R1)
if(nth == 0) {
	get second R3
	output second
}

get count R4
count = count + 1
mv count R4
get nth R1
nth = nth -1
mv nth R1
get first R2
temp = first
mv temp memory address 0X1 
first = second
mv first R2
get second R3
get temp memory address 0X1
second = second + temp
mv second R3
jemp linex (go to linex)
